                                <h2>White Space - Clean Design</h2>
                                <h4>Wikimedia Foundation</h4>
                        </div>

                        <p>As you can see, each element on this web page is clearly defined. Everything is enveloped by
                                white
                                space. It’s predictable and pleasing to the eye. After visiting their desktop page,
                                their idea
                                of a clean look expands. In fact, the amount of white space is used to create symbolic
                                imagery,
                                like a globe with languages all around creating the idea that everyone in the world can
                                use
                                their site. In general, their page succeeds at making white space their foundation upon
                                which to
                                build upon. It’s almost as though you are walking into a crisp, and clean library full
                                of fresh
                                books.</p>

                                alt="A web page explaining the fine details behind making a great pork chop"></a>
                        <p>Looking at this page, your mouth might start to salivate, why? This page is filled with
                                pictures of
                                delicious pork chops all through out the page. This is their version of repetition, and
                                it is
                                done rather well. Would you look at this site differently if the recipe did not have any
                                pictures? Sure. This aspect is directly related to helping the viewer know and
                                understand how
                                good the recipe is. This is how repetition works, it promotes a sense of comfort to the
                                viewer,
                                and helps them know that they are still on that page. Another example is the coloring of
                                their
                                text. That specific color accompanies you throughout the entire page. If the pictures,
                                and
                                repetitive colors weren’t there, you might feel bored and move away from the page.</p>

                        <p>Notice how everything has a designated place? There’s an invisible edge to the left that
                                draws your
                                eyes further and further down the page. The short paragraphs, large headings, and lack
                                of side
                                menus really create a clean, and organized look. When visiting their desktop version of
                                the
                                page, each section is still lined up, but there is more to it. The clean left edge is
                                more
                                apparent due to the fact that none of the paragraphs are indented, which is something
                                not
                                completely noticed in their mobile version. However, this is naturally pleasing to the
                                eyes.
                                Alignment is all about showing the eyes where to look, and this page does just that.</p>
