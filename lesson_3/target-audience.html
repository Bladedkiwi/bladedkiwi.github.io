                <h2>Target Audience</h2>

                <p>Our focus will be those in the age range of 30-50. Furthermore, those that have families, and love
                    going outdoors. The people we will be targeting will want to know
                    about wind speed, rain, how much rain, and how many days in the week have rain. They will also want
                    to
                    know of different states’ weather for their children away from home, and whether the local district
                    has
                    school or not. Our users will be using mainly their phones and tablets, but occasionally use their
                    computer to find the weather.</p>

                Abbigail is a mother of six children ranging from college age children to young elementary school
                age. She worries about her children, and always checks the weather for her children. She currently
                lives in an extreme weather zone that frequently has tornadoes.
                This leads her to check the weather daily, and sometimes multiple times a day. She expects the
                weather site to be responsive, and user friendly. Her phone is the most used method of technology.

                <h4>Description:</h4>
                Josh looks every morning at a weather site. The weather site he chooses is one that will give him
                the quickest access to weather conditions, wind speed, and how much rain will fall. Josh is an avid
                outdoor entrepreneur and enjoys biking, running, hiking, and golfing. He generally checks his phone
                or tablet in bed, and has only five minutes. He expects the site to work, and not require to many
                menus to find what he desires.

                <h2>Scenarios:</h2>

                <h3>What is the weather going to be today?</h3>
                <p>Viewer comes to site from their phone/tablet when waking up. Their need is to understand what they
                    should wear, and whether they need to bring rain gear.</p>

                <h3>Is the tornado touching down in my area?</h3>
                <p>Visitor will have heard the tornado sirens, or looked outside at the dark green clouds, and seek for
                    information from the web instead of the TV. They hope to find that it’s faster than the TV, and hope
                    to find things in under five minutes. Visitor generally uses their phone with phone WIFI if there
                    isn’t power.</p>

                <h3>What are the roads like in this area?</h3>
                <p>Visitor will be wishing to drive on the road, but they will notice the snowy weather outside, and
                    question what type of storm they will be having for today. Generally, visitors like these use their
                    choice of technology to find this out.</p>

                <h3>My lawn needs mowed, will there be rain this weekend?</h3>
                <p>Visitor desires to achieve household tasks, and doesn’t want to put off mowing his lawn for an
                    entire week. They check the site because of it, and if there’s rain, find that they should mow the
                    lawn earlier. Generally, visitors like these would look on their work computers.</p>
                <h3>What is the weather like in another state/country?</h3>
                <p>Visitor is either browser surfing, or worried about another areas weather conditions with someone
                    they know. They will possibly hear of such things from the news, and visit the site to find
                    information on the current conditions there. Information should be easily labelled to find as to not
                    deter the visitor from trying to find such things. This type of visitor has a short attention span,
                    and probably only lasts a minute before finding another webpage.</p>
